1. function component: when your main focus is on UI design.
2. class component:  when you need to deal with comples logic with design.

Notes: while creating component its file name must start capital letter

JSX(javascript+XML) : it makes react code easy, as well as it allows us to write html code in react component.
                     -in component two wrap multiple elemenent we have to use one parent element and parent elemenent must block elemenent like div,h1-h6.


*props : it is parameter or functional parameter use to pass data inside component.
        -it return object type of data. 
        -we write props in starting tag of component in key and value pairs. 
        -we can access props in function component  by write props.propsName. 
        -we can access props in class component  by write this.props.propsName.

        -we can access state data by writting this.state.properyname
        -form react version 16 we can use state in function component by using hook.

*setState : to update or change state data in class component for setState method is use.

*conditional Rendering : display component output or view on the basis condition 
1.if else: if condition is true then if block will execute 
2.element as variable: in this we store data in variable first and then we return that variable as an element.
3.use of ternary operator: it is an shorthand syntax for if else 
                          syntax:   (condition) ? truepart : falsepart;
4.short-circuit (&&): it will display lement or component output only if condition is true.

*use extension for creating component in react 
rce : it will gender class component structure 
rconst : it will generate constructor with super method and state 
rfce: it will generate normal function component.
rafce: it will generate arrow function component.

if you want to create parent child relation inbetweeb component for this first you have import child component in parent component and write its name as tag. 


*PureComponent:-it is react component which prevent un-necessary re-Rendering of class component.
               -by performing shallow comparision it chek data if it is same then it preven component to re-render.
               -to achive we have extends class component with PureComponent.
*React.memo():  it ie reat method which  prevent un-necessary re-Rendering of class component. 
-by performing shallow comparision it chek data if it is same then it preven component to re-render.
-to achive this you have to pass component name as an argument to React.memo() method
